# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summarized table of the ride-sharing data by city type and then create a plot that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

# Results

## Ride Sharing Data

[insert plot]

As expected, the urban city type has the most drivers and total rides compared to the suburban and rural city types. Because of the number of rides in urban areas, PyBer is able to provide lower fare costs per ride. Even with that stipulation, urban areas are still bringing in the majority of the revenue. Drivers can expect to make more money per ride in rural areas, but may not make as much money overall due to the lower ride count.


## Total Weekly Fares

[insert plot]

Urban areas consistently had higher fare totals on a weekly basis. Rural areas had the lowest. The third week in February proved to be profitable for all 3 city types as they all exhibited a peak on the plot at this time.

# Summary
It would be worth looking into what was going on to cause this spike in total fares during the third week of February to determine if ride count increased or fare price.
